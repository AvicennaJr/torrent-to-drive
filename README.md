# Torrent to Google Drive

A simple program to download torrent files to your google drive. This is useful in areas where you have unlimited internet access but are prohibited from using torrents (eg in University)

## How To Use

- Sign up for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
- Upload this notebook (go to files -> upload)
- Connect to runtime (top left) and start executing each cell
- For torrent links, paste them in the `Add from magnet link` cell. Add as many as links as you want then type `exit` when you're done.
- For torrent files, add them via the `add from torrent file` cell. You can add as many files as you want.
- Execute the `Start download` cell to start downloading.

**Make sure that your drive has enough space to accomodate your downloads**
